getPvalues.R
-------------

This file contains the code to scrape the P-values from pubmed (either run it first, or use the already
calculated pvalueData.rda)



calculateSwfdr.R
-------------

This file contains the function to estimate the science-wise false discovery rate


journalAnalysis.R
-------------

This file contains the code to reproduce the quantities and figures in the Jager/Leek paper


journalAnalysisHelp.R
-------------

This file contains a helper function necessary for journalAnalysis.R


pvalueData.rda
-------------

The pre-computed p-value data used for the Jager/Leek paper in .rda format. 


simulation.R
------------

A simulation study comparing our estimates to the truth when the assumptions hold and when they are badly violated. 


To reproduce the results in the Jager/Leek paper
---------------------------------------

Either: (1) Run getPvalues.R to obtain the p-value data, (2) Run journalAnalysis.R
Or: (2) Run journalAnalysis.R using the pre-computed pvalueData.rda

Note, because of the bootstrapping calculations, these functions may take a while (think order hours) to run.
